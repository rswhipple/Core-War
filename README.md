# Core Wars
### Project Status
The project is at a minimal viable product stage as of our initail March 11th, 2024 deadline. The assembler is fully operational, and the virtual machine can execute multiple programs.
### Next Steps
In the next iteration of this project we intend to:
* refactor the assembler to handle more edge cases 
* complete outstanding functions in the virtual machine (fork, lfork and zjmp)
* create a visualizer 
* experiment with a variety of player instruction sets. 

# About
Core Wars consists of programs that run in a virtual machine. Each program's objective is to execute a special instruction ("live"), within a specified number of cycles. These programs simultaneously execute in the virtual machine and in the
same memory zone, which enables them to write on one another.
The project is coded in C. ðŸ˜Ž

The project is divided into three separate parts:

*Virtual Machine*
â€“ This is the controlled environment where the programs will run. It must provide all essential features for program execution and support the simultaneous execution of multiple programs.

*Assembler*
â€“ At the heart of the system, the assembler defines syntax and rules for creating valid programs. Its role is to produce binary code that the Virtual Machine can execute.

*Programs*
â€“ These are the entities that run within the Virtual Machine and interact with it. Written in the specific assembly language tailored for the Virtual Machine, programs must execute within the VM's confines.
