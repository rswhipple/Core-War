OUR CORE WARS PSEUDO CODE
Program will not start unless at least two and a maximum of four assembly files are provided

Actions to take upon initiating Program:
    * initialize core_t with a champion
    * execute champion instructions in a loop
    

Structs that need to be defined:
    * core_t
        - memory space
        - registers
        - ac couter flag?
        - carry flag?
    * champion_t
        - needs NAME_OF_PROGRAM
        - NBR_OF_PROGRAM
        - needs an array of instructions

Q's to ask:
    * What is OP_NOTHING and OP_NB?
    * Do we need to create a separate "live" struct?
    * How does the header_t work? Connected to the assembler? Verify champions data?
    * Does each champion have its own set of registers??
